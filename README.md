# Federated MNIST Training with LIFL -Based on LIFL: A LIGHTWEIGHT, EVENT-DRIVEN SERVERLESS PLATFORM FOR FEDERATED LEARNING

This project implements **federated learning** using the **MNIST dataset** and simulates training across **10 clients** with hierarchical aggregation. Itâ€™s inspired by the paper *Asynchronous Hierarchical Federated Learning (LIFL)*.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

âœ… Actual model training on MNIST  
âœ… 10 simulated clients  
âœ… Logs of per-round loss/accuracy  
âœ… Results visualization  
âœ… Easily extensible (middle aggregator, non-IID data)

## ðŸ§  Architecture

- **Client**: Trains on local MNIST data
- **Aggregator**: Averages models from all clients
- (Optional) **Hierarchical**: Add mid-level aggregators for real-world simulation
